To execute each exercise you can do it using a IDE for java development and run the Main class.
It can also be executed through the command line from the projects path in src/main/java using 'java Main.java', to do so you will have to add the JDK bin path to the PATH variable
To execute the 3rd exercise you'll need to use a Linux based computer, due to the fact that it has been programmed to execute bash commands and not cmd ones
